    <h4>
      Q16.1 \(\quad\) Invariant subspace in Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system
    </h4>

    The one dimensional Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation 
    \[
    u_t + \frac{1}{2}(u^2)_x + u_{xx} + u_{xxxx} = 0\,,\quad x \in [0, L]
    \]
    describes the velocity of flame front in a circular shape. 
    Expand \(u(t,x)\) in Fourier basis:
    \( u(x_n,t) = \sum^{\infty}_{n=-\infty} \hat{u}_k e^{iq_k x_n} \,,\)
    where \(q_k = 2\pi k/L\), We obtain the dynamics in terms of Fourier modes:
    \[
    \dot{\hat{u}}_k = (q_k^2 - q_k^4) \hat{u}_k - \frac{iq_k}{2} 
    \sum^{\infty}_{m=-\infty} \hat{u}_m  \hat{u}_{k-m}
    \]
    Note, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky equation is anti-symmetric under reflection:
    \( u(x) \to -u(-x) \). Thus, 
    pure imaginary modes form invariant subspace of this system. In this
    homework, we work in this subspace: \(\hat{u}_k = i a_k\). The flow becomes
    \[
    \dot{a}_k = (q_k^2 - q_k^4) a_k + \frac{q_k}{2} 
    \sum^{N}_{m=-N} a_m  a_{k-m}
    \] 
    Here, we truncate the Fourier modes, only keeping the lowest \(2N+1\)
    modes. Due to Galilean invariance \(u(x,t) \to u(x-ct, t)+c\), we
    can set the mean velocity \(\int_0^L u dx \) to zero without loss 
    of generality, which 
    is \(a_0 = 0\). This can be confirmed by \(\dot{a}_0 = 0\). 
    Also, real field \(u(x,t)\) means \(\hat{u}^*_k = \hat{u}_{-k}\), 
    so \(a_{-k} = -a_k\). Taking all these facts into consideration,
    we end up with a state space: \((a_1, a_2, \cdots, a_N)\). In this 
    homework, set \( N = 16 \).
    <br><br>
    
    From everyday
    experience, we know that flame front can flutter every so often, so
    the system is actually chaotic. Here, we study how the domain size
    \(L\) affects the dynamics in the invariant subspace. In the template
    code, please fill out all required functions and set "case=1" to validate
    your implementation. In this case, you are supposed to get 2 figures. One
    is the state space projected onto the first 3 Fourier modes. The other 
    is the color-mapped configuration space. They may be  
    (a) and (b), or (c) or (d) at bottom of this page. It depends because
    the system is chaotic for the domain sizes used in case = 1.
    Also confirm that the velocity printed out is correct. 
    Please consult chapter 30 section 30.7 to get the energy formula. Set
    domain size \(L = 36.23\), integrate the system for a long time. What 
    is the average energy ? ( 2 significant digits should be accurate. )

    <h4>
      Q16.2 \(\quad\) Period-doubling bifurcation
    </h4>

    Period-doubling is a common source of bifurcation. A slight
    change in parameter space may give birth to a sudden transition
    in the state space from a single stable state to double states 
    oscillation. Dynamics in the anti-symmetric subspace in 
    Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system exhibits this phenomenon. 
    In order to observe this bifurcation, let us work on a Poincare 
    section \(a_1 = 0\).  Start from a random state point, and 
    evolve the system forward. Discard the transient evolution, and
    record the energy whenever this ergodic trajectory reaches the
    Poincare section. Please finish case 2 in the template code. 
    Try different domain sizes \(L \in [36.20, 36.40]\), 
    and plot the dependence of energy on \(L\). You will get a Feigenbaum 
    bifurcation tree as shown in figure (e) below. 
    <br><br>
    
    The Poincare section direction I used is from negative \(a_1\) to 
    positive \(a_1\). If you get an upside down figure compared to 
    figure (e), please change the direction of your Poincare section.
    Also, you have noticed that there is a sharp cliff in the bifurcation
    tree. That is related to the discrete symmetry 
    \(a_{2k} \to a_{2k}\), \(a_{2k+1} \to -a_{2k+1}\). For more details,
    see reference [1] at the bottom.
    <br><br>
    
    Period can not only get doubled but also tripled as shown in (e).
    At \(L\sim 36.25\), the first doubling occurs. As \(L\) is increased,
    each branch goes trough doubling and this process repeats until it 
    becomes chaotic. At a specific \(L\), system reaches a period-3 cycle
    and then after some chaotic region, reaches a period-5 cycle...
    Look at figure (e), there is a window containing a stable period-3 cycle.
    At what \(L\) this window starts ? 
    ( Note, please keep at least 2 decimal digits accurate. )

    <h4>
      Q16.3 \(\quad\) Equilibria in anti-symmetric space 
    </h4>

    Every time we try to figure out the geometry of 
    a nonlinear flow, we first try to find some 
    equilibria ( or relative equilibria ) which cooperate 
    to shape the structure of this flow. It turns out that
    there are dozens of equilibria for Kuramoto-Sivashinsky system
    in the anti-symmetric invariant subspace with relatively large
    \(L\). They are not equally important. For example, let 
    \(L=36.33\). Figures (f) and (g) below display the same stable
    equilibrium, but figure (g) also shows the main attractor
    ( green curve ). You see
    that the stable manifold of this equilibrium is far away from
    the main attractor. In figure (f),
    trajectory is spiraling inward the equilibrium.  However, figure 
    (h) shows an unstable equilibrium and its unstable manifold, which
    lands on the main attractor. So you see, this unstable equilibrium 
    plays a more important role than that stable equilibrium in shaping 
    the geometry in the state space. 
    <br><br>
    
    Both equilibria are given to you in file "eq.npz". 
    Please finish case 3 to visualize these two equilibria.
    Note, please set \(L=36.33\) in this experiment.
    What is the real part of the leading
    expanding stability exponent of this unstable equilibrium ?
    ( Please keep at least 2 significant digits accurate and do not
    use scientific notation. )

    <h4>
      Q16.4 \(\quad\) Return map and cycle expansion 
    </h4>

    We are equipped with all basic tools: integrator, stability matrix, 
    important equilibrium, etc. Then we can construct the one dimensional
    return map as we did in two-mode system. At the unstable equilibrium,
    use the unstable eigenvectors to construct a Poincare section and
    choose a state point close to this equilibrium 
    in the expanding direction as initial condition and generate an 
    ergodic trajectory. Store the Poincare intersection points and order 
    them by their curvilinear distance to the equilibrium. Therefore, we
    get the 1-d return map.  
    <br><br>
    
    Then we figure out the pruning rule of this 
    map by using kneading theory, after which the symbolic dynamics is 
    obtained. Then start from the points where the map intersects the
    diagonal line,
    we retrieve and find all the periodic orbits up to a certain 
    topological length. Finally, with this set of 
    periodic orbits, we turn to cycle expansion of dynamical zeta function
    or spectral determinant to predict 
    some physical properties inside this system. 
    <br><br>
    
    I just sketched the basic procedure of applying What ChaosBook 
    teaches us towards a real world problem. We are trying to convince you 
    that high dimensional real world problem can be reduced to a one 
    dimensional map and cycle expansion is effective to predict the
    long time behavior of flow in this high dimensional space.
    This homework comes from the work done in reference [1] and [2], which 
    have the cycle expansion result. 
    <br><br>
    
    Due to limited time, we do not expect your cycle expansion result, 
    so this problem will not
    be graded. However, we strongly recommend finishing the remaining work and 
    compare your result with that in references [1] and [2].
